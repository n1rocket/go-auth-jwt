# Refactoring Summary - Clean Code Implementation

## Overview
Successfully applied Clean Code principles and best practices to reorganize the go-auth-jwt project, eliminating large files and improving overall structure.

## Major Changes

### 1. Request/Response Utilities
- Created `internal/http/request/decoder.go` - Generic request decoder with validation
- Created `internal/http/response/builder.go` - Fluent interface for HTTP responses
- Implemented Decorator pattern for request handling
- Reduced code duplication across handlers

### 2. Email Builder Extraction
- Created `internal/email/builder.go` - MIME message builder
- Reduced `smtp.go` from 220 to 183 lines
- Improved separation of concerns

### 3. Error Handling System
- Created `internal/errors/errors.go` - Domain error types
- Created `internal/errors/registry.go` - Error to HTTP status mapping
- Centralized error handling with Registry pattern

### 4. Service Layer Refactoring
- Split `AuthService` into three focused services:
  - `UserService` - User management and credentials
  - `TokenService` - JWT and refresh token management
  - `VerificationService` - Email verification logic
- Applied Single Responsibility Principle

### 5. Handler Decomposition
- Split `auth.go` (345 lines) into:
  - `signup.go` - Registration handler
  - `login.go` - Authentication handler
  - `token.go` - Token refresh/logout handlers
  - `profile.go` - User profile handler

### 6. Context Package
- Created `internal/http/context/keys.go`
- Resolved circular dependency between handlers and middleware
- Centralized context key definitions

### 7. Monitoring Dashboard Refactoring
- Created `internal/monitoring/templates/` directory
- Extracted 239-line HTML template to `dashboard.html`
- Used Go's embed feature for template loading
- Reduced `dashboard.go` significantly

### 8. Metrics Reorganization
- Split `metrics.go` into domain-specific files:
  - `http.go` - HTTP metrics
  - `auth.go` - Authentication metrics
  - `email.go` - Email metrics
  - `database.go` - Database metrics
  - `system.go` - System metrics
  - `business.go` - Business metrics
  - `ratelimit.go` - Rate limiting metrics
- Changed from struct fields to getter methods
- Improved metric organization and discoverability

## Results

### File Size Reduction
- `auth.go`: 345 lines → Split into 4 files (~80-100 lines each)
- `smtp.go`: 220 lines → 183 lines
- `dashboard.go`: ~500 lines → ~250 lines
- `metrics.go`: ~800 lines → Split into 8 files (~100-150 lines each)

### Code Quality Improvements
- Eliminated circular dependencies
- Applied SOLID principles throughout
- Improved testability with interface segregation
- Enhanced code reusability with common utilities
- Better separation of concerns

### Testing
- All unit tests passing
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- Maintained backward compatibility

## Design Patterns Applied
1. **Builder Pattern** - Response and email builders
2. **Decorator Pattern** - Request validation
3. **Registry Pattern** - Error handling
4. **Repository Pattern** - Already in use, maintained
5. **Service Layer Pattern** - Split into focused services

## Next Steps (Optional)
1. Consider extracting validation rules to separate files
2. Add more comprehensive integration tests
3. Document new utilities in the README
4. Consider adding more middleware utilities
