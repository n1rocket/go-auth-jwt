## 🛠️ Technical Decisions

### Core Principles

1. **Minimal Dependencies**: Prefer stdlib, justify every external dependency
2. **Clean Architecture**: Clear separation between layers
3. **Testability**: Interfaces for easy mocking, dependency injection
4. **Security First**: Defense in depth, principle of least privilege
5. **Observable**: Metrics, logs, and traces from day one

### Key Technology Choices

| Component | Choice | Rationale |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| HTTP Router | `net/http` + `ServeMux` | Simplicity, no external deps |
| Database | PostgreSQL | Battle-tested, ACID compliance |
| JWT Library | `golang-jwt/jwt` | Well-maintained, security focused |
| Password Hashing | `golang.org/x/crypto/bcrypt` | Industry standard |
| Configuration | Environment variables | 12-factor app compliance |
| Logging | `log/slog` | Structured, performant |
| Metrics | Prometheus | Industry standard |
| Container | Alpine/Scratch | Minimal attack surface |
